# Fourteen-Segment-Arduino-Library
A library for non-I2C common-cathode fourteen-segment LED displays to connect with an Arduino. I used the Luckylight KWA-541CVB, but any should work.
To use, clone or download the repository and place all files into a sketch folder. Look through example.ino and either use the listed pinouts or modify them to match your pin mapping. Flash example.ino to the Arduino.
